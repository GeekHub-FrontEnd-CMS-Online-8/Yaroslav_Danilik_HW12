Tasks: 
1. Make all first letters in words uppercased. 
For example: 	inputString = “wSSde rr 3!D !!fg __AAs cert”
outputString = “WSSde Rr 3!D !!fg __AAs Cert”

2. Check if given string contains some other string. 
For example: 	For this strings function should return true.
inputString1 = “A big red apple.”
InputString2 = “RED is a registered trade mark.”
inputString3 = “ReD is his nickname.”
checkString = “red”

3. Truncate string. You have string and number of characters to left. After string ‘…’ should be added. 
For example: 	inputString = “This is example of log string that should be truncated.”
		length = 7
		outputString = “This is…”

4. Write function that will return minimum or maximum value from array depending on second argument. Input args: array, string (‘min’, ‘max). For example: findMinMax([1, 7, 90, 22], ‘min’)

5. Write function to transform array into object. Ex.:
{
    'a' : arr[0],
    'b' : arr[1],
    ...
    '1' : arr[n],
    '2' : arr[n+1],
    ...
}

6. Write function that will take object as argument and return sum of all its attribute values that are numbers.

7. Fix code:

var a = 10;

function equal(val1, val2) {
	return val1 === val2;
}
console.log(equal(a, b));  // Should log true to console

var b = 10;

8. Make this work without changing order of lines:

var a;
console.log(a()); //Should log true to console
a = function a() {
  return true;
};
